# 📌 Cozniture

Cozniture is a web application that leverages 3D and Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for product presentation. It aims to improve the overall experience for both customers and merchants, providing a win-win solution. This project was a major part of my university work, covering both frontend and backend development.

## 📝 Description

The idea behind Cozniture is to revolutionize the e-commerce market by integrating immersive 3D and AR features. Although such technologies have been around for over a decade, they gained real traction around 2016–2017.

Cozniture includes all standard e-commerce features along with advanced product presentation using 3D and AR.
